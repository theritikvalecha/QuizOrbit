# QuizOrbit: The Interactive Knowledge Hub

Welcome to **QuizOrbit**! This is a fun, fast-paced web application designed to test your
brain across different subjects like General Knowledge, English, and IQ. Whether you want
to prepare for an exam or just kill some time with a mental workout, QuizOrbit has you
covered.

**What makes this project special?**

- **Modern Design:** A cool, dark-themed interface with glowing "orbit" animations that
    follow you through the login and signup process.
- **Smart Storage:** No need for a complex database. Your account details are saved
    directly in your browser using **LocalStorage**.
- **The Timer Challenge:** Every question features a "cartoon-style" animated timer. You
    have 10 seconds to answer before the bar runs out and locks the question!
- **Difficulty Levels:** Choose your challenge! Every subject comes with **Easy** , **Medium** ,
    and **Hard** modes.

# How it was built (Tech Stack)

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For the structure and that smooth, dark-blue aesthetic.
- **JavaScript:** The "brain" of the app that handles the quiz logic, timers, and scoring.
- **LocalStorage:** Used to remember users and keep your session secure without a
    backend server.
